# iphone alarms for shabbat and yom tov

This app is not released yet, and still has significant bugs to be worked out in relation to the new AlarmKit API.

I hope to work it out this month, but as always, buyer beware! :)

## features

* play alarms for a shorter time than Apple Clock, to reduce annoyance of not dismissing them
* automatically handle holidays
* use the new, robust alarm support in ios 26

## todo

1. custom alarms - AlarmKit issue
2. support using for weekdays
3. disabling alarms
4. background task
5. "about" window
6. donations
7. durations
